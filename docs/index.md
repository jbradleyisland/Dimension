# Dimension Script


## Install

* `Y:\Island_Library\Scripting\Addins\Dimension.exe` - Installs the Dimension Add-In for Revit

## Run the Script

  To run the script all you need to do is click the Dimension icon under your Add-Ins tab.
## Execute Dimension

* Once the dimension script is run you will be prompted to select a dimension option:
    1. Center-Line: Dimension to the center-line reference within the family.
    2. Face:  Select a face that each element of the same family will be dimensioned to.

* After a dimension option has been selected you can then select all of the elements you'd like to have dimensioned.

* If you selected Face based dimensioning you will then have to select a reference line or face for each family in your selection. All instances of a Family-Type will be dimensioned to the same reference line or face.

* Done! Once you've made your selection the script will dimension each element selected and produce a dimension line!
